In project 3 of my OpenClassrooms course I had to create a web page advertising a film festival in Brooklyn, NY.  The main goal of the project was to use bootstrap to establish the layout and main components (ie movie cards, buttons, ect) for the web page.  Also, more advanced css (i.e. transitions and transforms) was used to create a well designed and effective advertising page.  Furthermore, I used media queries to ensure all parts of the page were responsive in all view port sizes. Below I will go over the main parts of the web page, and discuss how I used bootstrap, css3 and responsive web design to successfully create a well designed and convincing film festival web page.

!['header'](https://github.com/mbdev95/OpenClassrooms-Project-3-Brooklyn-Film-Festival/blob/master/img/Project-3-README-Images/Header.PNG)

The header in the image above was created using bootstrap components such a nav element and a jumbotron in conjunction with custom css.  

!['responsive header'](https://github.com/mbdev95/OpenClassrooms-Project-3-Brooklyn-Film-Festival/blob/master/img/Project-3-README-Images/Responsive-Header.PNG)

The header was made responsive in all viewport widths by using the bootstrap classes of navbar-expand-lg and navbar-collapse to allow bootstrap's stylesheet to expand the navbar in greater widths then bootstrap's large break-point.

!['movie cards'](https://github.com/mbdev95/OpenClassrooms-Project-3-Brooklyn-Film-Festival/blob/master/img/Project-3-README-Images/Movie-Cards.PNG)

Each movie was given a basic description in an organized way using bootstrap's card component. The cards were placed in responsive columns using the bootstrap grid with the columns going from 1 columns in small viewports, to 2 columns in medium viewports, and finally 3 columns in bootstrap's extra-large viewport width.
